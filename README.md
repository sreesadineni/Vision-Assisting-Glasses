PROBLEM STATEMENT:-

                                     Difficulty to navigate around places for visually impaired people. Blind people roam easily around their house without any help because they know the position of everything in the house, but they face a lot of challenges when they visit any unfamiliar places.

ABSTRACT :-

The biggest challenge for a blind person, especially the one with the complete loss of vision, is to navigate around places. Obviously, blind people face a lot of difficulty while visiting any unfamiliar places.The most valuable thing for a disabled person is gaining independence. A blind person can lead an independent life with some special devices designed for them but the only problem is they are not easily available in the local shops or markets. Our vision assisting glasses can overcome all the above constraints and aid for developing confidence in visually impaired .

 OUR SOLUTION:-

Our solution for the above problem is to build smart glasses which are specially designed for visually impaired .These glasses contains all the features which are useful in guiding a blind person in unfamiliar places without a need of companion.It requires as many less components as   possible for helping the users in sensing the objects in front of them using sensors and recognising their family members using mini camera and informing the user vocally.

REQUIREMENTS:-

Raspberry pi
Ultrasonic sensor
Mini camera
Glasses
USB cable and Wires
Battery 5v/power bank

MECHANISM:

Our vision assisting glasses consists of raspberry pi which functions as main board on which all the required components of the project are connected. Our first objective is to ensure the safety of the user so ultrasonic sensor is used to calculate the distance of the obstacle, if any obstacle is present in their way and our second objective is to recognise the people around the user and inform them if they are family members or any stranger is approaching them.  All the above   features can be obtained in our project with the help of sensor and a mini camera inserted in the glasses.We can even include few other optional features like Bluetooth module , if there are proper resources and time. while connecting Bluetooth with phone, the user can also access Google maps or any other apps easily which helps them reach any destination without much trouble.

ADVANTAGES OF OUR SOLUTION:-

DESIGN
COST EFFECTIVENESS
ADAPTABLE
VERSATILE
EASY TO MANUFACTURE



CONCLUSION:-

The main objective of our project is to help the vulnerable people make them less dependent and assist them in ignoring their disabilities and lead a happy life.
We hope our project might help many blind people who face difficulty in finding a companion in life.
